# Installation
1. Download the zip file and extract it to your local machine.
2. Download Android Studio on your local machine.
3. Open the project folder from Android Studio.
4. To run this project, you need to either run it on your own Android Device or on an Emulator.
    -  If using an Android Device, connect your device via a USB cable (will need to enable USB debugging) or WiFi. Once connected, your device will appear at the top right. Run app
    -  If you are using an emulator, you will need to go to Device Manager and Create Device. For reference, we created a Pixel 4 Virtual Device with API 33, but feel free to create whatever device of you choosing with a minimum of API 21 - 33
     
# User Interfaces
We have created the following User Interfaces:
1. Login / Register
    -  When creating a profile, for SUID, use "000000000" as it is a valid SUID and will grant you Club and Event Leader privileges.
3. Forgot Password
    -  When testing, a link will be sent to the user's email, so ensure that you have access to the email you have used.
4. Home Page
5. Club Detail / Review
6. Event Detail
7. Calendar
8. Leader Page
9. Create Club / Event
10. Profile Page / Profile Edit

Note: You will need to upload a picture from your device for 9 and 10. Be aware that if you are using an emulator, when uploading photos, you will not have any on the device. A workaround we found was to use a Google Photos account, upload a photo onto there, and then log into your Google Photos account on the emulator. It will take some time for the emulator to get the photo when you upload your photo to Google Photos, but it will appear evantually.
